/*
Farhan must pay a bill to a shopkeeper. The shopkeeper doesnï¿½t have any change,
so Farhan must have all the notes required to pay the bill.
Write a C program that reads the bill and the number of each type of note
(500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1) from user and then output whether it is possible
for Farhan to pay the bill or not. If it is possible, then also output the
number of each notes required to pay the bill.
